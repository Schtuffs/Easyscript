#Welcome to Easyscript!

##Plans for additions.

###Basic image recognition
I'm hoping to add some basic image recognition that will be able to figure out 
where an image is and be able to give back its (x, y) coordinates. Scaling and 
maybe rotation will be attempted to be added later.

###Other OS's
Currently know it works for windows, will check functionality on linux. MacOS 
is unknown right now since I do not have any Mac systems. Most likely will not 
do anything with Darwin since I believe its unsupported now.

##Plans for fixes

###Changing object properties
I would like to change the main easyscript object to a singleton so that there 
is only one instance, so that any changes to pause or anything are less confusing
between having multiple objects. I would also like to change more properties to 
being private instead of public but its easier for testing to have them public 
in the mean time.

##General maintenance

###Code improvements
Will be refactoring code as I learn better (more efficient or faster) methods.

###Updates and main maintenance
New features will be added as I learn more. Maintenance for bugs will be fixed 
as they are found before new features are added.

##Thank you!
